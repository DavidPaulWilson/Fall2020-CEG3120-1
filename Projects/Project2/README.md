# Project 2-1

## The Story

You've been convinced to join a startup company as their primary (and right now, only) systems admin. It's unclear on what their goal is, but the pay is good, so you're ready for the ride.

While the new CEO runs around looking for developers, you've been tasked with getting some basic infrastructure setup. You will start by building out a directory service (phonebook) and a project repository server. Since the CEO loves linux, they requested that you use SLAPD for the directory service and GitLab as the repository server.

Since you've walked the startup road before, you know to thoroughly document everything. Since email is not a good documentation method, you're going to separately keep track of things on a private GitHub repository.

## Objectives:

- Create a VPC on AWS.
- Create two instances, one for GitLab, one for SLAPD.
  - Note: You may use AMIs
- Attach an IP address to each.
- Install the services on the instances
- Make networking decisions and open ports appropriately.
- Configure GitLab for LDAP authentication
