# Project 2-2 - NOT FINALIZED

Now that you have learned some lessons about AWS, you are going to vow to try not to mess with all of those buttons again. Your goal is to create a Cloud Formation template, a file that creates a VPC and the minimum servers so far (one git server, one openldap server)

The CEO has convinced a few developers to join in on the fun! Now that you have some people, you can add them to your directory service.

## Objectives:

1. Create a CloudFormation Template that can recreate your environment installation - from the VPC to the two systems we have created so far.

- [Example Configuration File](https://github.com/mkijowski/aws-cf-templates/blob/master/course-templates/ceg3400.yml)
- Note: to keep costs down, you will need to delete your Cloud Stack in between build & test
