# Project 1 - 2.0

## Details
This project will be using your script from Project 1 to create & resolve issues via GitHub
* Create issues associated with the feedback given on the rubric.
    * Each TODO you solve in your rubric should have an associated issue created.
    * Each solved issue can gain credit to your original Project 1 submission.
        * You can still do the extra credit listed in Project 1.  Perhaps use a label of "enhancement"
* Create a git usage guide called `Git-Guide.md` in the main folder of your repository that details the following:
    * Basic git usage (how to add, commit, & push)
    * What causes a pull request (ie. main not up to date with local) and how to resolve
    * How to create an issue & how to solve issues
    * Note: You may copy / paste words from other guides but you must credit them
