# Repository Layout:
1. Resources Page:  Document resources you used to complete the project requirements.  Use markdown to create section headers for organization
2. README Page: Document how to use this project
   * README will be updated each project with a "changelog"
3. Script directory:  Inner directories will have scripts corresponding to each project (ex. Project1 will have scripts associated with project 1 inside)
