# Project 1:

## Goal:
Create a script that, once run, will configure your server and user directory to your custom preferences.  This script will be the only thing to run on a new system.  Internal to the script should be any service restarts needed - a user should not need to do any additional action.

### Repository Layout:
Please add the instructor (`pattonsgirl`) to your repository.
1. Resources Page:  
   * Document resources you used to complete the project requirements.  
   * Use markdown to create section headers for organization
2. README Page: 
   * Living usage document that will have a section for each Project
   * README will be updated each project with a "changelog"
   * Use markdown to create section headers for organization
3. Script folder:  
   * Will have scripts corresponding to each project 

### Minimum the script should do:
Each of the requirements below should be in their own function.

1. Add the script directory to your PATH
   * Your script should only do this if the **command to run your script** does not exist
   * Append to your `.profile` file
2. Change the `motd` to reflect information you are interested in.
   * Remove at least one default message
   * Add at least one custom message (i-nodes used, processes running, friendly fortune...)
3. Make `vim` more you.
   * Install the plugin to the directories needed.  Store pre requisite files on your github page, if needed.  If it requires a large download, have your script use `curl` or `wget` to download the file for installation.
4. Make `alias` your ally.
   * Required alias:
      * An `alias` called `aws-ssh` that contains the command and parameters you have been using to log on to your AWS Educate system.
   * Second `alias` ideas: 
      * Truncate a common git command / git process into a lovely one liner 
      * A lighthearted command that prints out something nice (think `cowsay` or `fortune`)
   * Your script should reload `.bashrc` for you.
      * 9/18/2020 update: your script should "reload" .bashrc but **leave a note in the script output that the user needs to do this** (ie. Run `$ source .bashrc` to reload).
   * Your `alias` commands should only be added to `.bashrc` if they do not exist.
      * [Hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9783507/how-can-i-check-in-my-bashrc-if-an-alias-was-already-set)
5. Create a `-help` option
   * Help should detail what the script does

### Extra Credit (10%)
Impress me.  Pick from one of below options:
* Scrape a daily message off a website for the `motd`
* Create a user interface with tput
   * https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-user-interface.php
* Create a menu for the script
   * https://www.shellscript.sh/tips/getopts/ 
   * Minimum of â€“i (dash i) for install & -h (dash h) for help / usage
